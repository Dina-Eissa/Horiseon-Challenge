# Horiseon-Challenge
For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired someone to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. I improve it without changing what it does.
This is a marketing website that explains all details related to Search Engine Optimization also the Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing.

## User Story
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
